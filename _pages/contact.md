In case our email servers experience issues, you can alternatively reach us at our Gmail address: [yeahgamesdevs@gmail.com](yeahgamesdevs@gmail.com). However, please note that emails sent to this Gmail address are checked less frequently.

For specific contacts when there isn't a specific email provided, you can use the following method. Please be aware that the processing time may be longer, as these emails will be sorted from the main admin mailbox rather than being directly delivered to the dedicated mailbox of the requested site. To contact us, send an email to [mail@yeahgames.net](mailto:mail@yeahgames.net) or admin@yeahgames.net with a "+" attachment to the front of the email address. The attachment should include the related site on the network. For example, to contact yEAh Games Sites, you can reach us at [admin+sites@yeahgames.net](mailto:admin+sites@yeahgames.net) or [mail+sites@yeahgames.net]([mail+sites@yeahgames.net](mailto:mail+sites@yeahgames.net)). Your message will be forwarded to the appropriate mailbox after sorting.
